# caption.now

A privacy-first, offline-capable image captioning web app that keeps your data on your device.

## Features

- **Detailed Captions, Locally**: Describe your images with precision and ease.
- **Optimized Workflow**: Use hotkeys and AI assistance to speed up the captioning process.
- **Privacy-Focused, Offline First**: caption.now is a web app with no backend. All images and captions stay on your computer, ensuring complete control over your data.
- **Optional Local AI Integration**: Connect with [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) for AI-powered captioning. Ollama runs locally on your device, keeping everything private and offline.

### Motivation

Creating detailed image captions is essential for AI training and data preparation. While several server-based solutions like LabelStudio offer similar capabilities, they often require a hosted server, may store data externally.

caption.now is built with privacy and ease-of-use in mind, offering a lightweight, offline-first alternative. Since caption.now runs entirely on your device, there’s no server communication or data upload. Even with the AI integration, using Ollama for captioning assistance, everything remains local — you run Ollama on your device, maintaining complete privacy.

caption.now is designed to work offline, meaning you can disconnect from the internet after opening it, and continue captioning without interruptions. You can also return to caption.now anytime to resume your work offline.

## Getting Started

1. Open caption.now [here](https://caption.now).
2. Start captioning! No installation required.

If you prefer, you can also clone this repository to run caption.now locally or deploy it on your own web server.

For AI-assisted captioning, you may want to install Ollama, which is available for all operating systems and allows you to run popular open-source language and vision models entirely offline.
